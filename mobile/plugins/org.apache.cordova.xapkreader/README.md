phonegap-xapkreader
===================

Cordova plugin to access files in APK Expansion Files for Cordova/Phonegap Android application.

The plugin is an implementation of the process described here : [APK Expansion Files](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html)

# Installation

This plugin use the Cordova CLI's plugin command. To install it to your application, simply execute the following (and replace variables).

```
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.xapkreader --variable MAIN_VERSION=1 --variable PATCH_VERSION=1 --variable FILE_SIZE=1095520
```

- `MAIN_VERSION` :  Can be `1` or `0`. Define if your APK expansion file is the main file or a patch.
- `PATCH_VERSION` :  The version of your expansion file.
- `FILE_SIZE` : The byte size of your expansion file. This is used to verify the int√©grity of the file after downloading.

After installation you need to edit `src/org/apache/cordova/xapkreader/XAPKDownloaderService.java` to put your own application public key.

Further, you need to add the your application the __Downloader Library__ and __APK Expansion Zip Library__ from the `Android Extras` section using the Android SDK manager (run `android`).

This libraries are respectively located in :
- APK Expansion Zip Library : `<sdk>/extras/google/google_market_apk_expansion/zip_file/`
- Downloader Library : `<sdk>/extras/google/market_apk_expansion/downloader_library/`

Note that the Downloader Library require the __Google Play Licensing Library__ located in `<sdk>/extras/google/market_licensing/`.

You can find an explanation on how to do this in the following page : [Preparing to use the Downloader Library](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html#Preparing)

# Using

The file is returned to a success callback as URL object that you can use like in the example below or with the File API.

```
XAPKReader.get(filename, successCallback, [errorCallback], [fileType]);
```

## Parameters

- **filename** : The name of the file to load form the expansion file
- **successCallback** : The callback that executes when the file is loaded.
- **errorCallback** (Optional) : The callback that executes if an error occurs.
- **fileType** (Optional) : The file type.
